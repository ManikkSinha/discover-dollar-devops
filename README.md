# Discover Dollar DevOps Assignment – Clean Scaffold

This repo is prepared as a clean DevOps scaffold.

## What you still need to add manually

1. Put **company's Angular app code** inside `frontend/` (same level as Dockerfile).
2. Put **company's Node/Express backend code** inside `backend/` (same level as Dockerfile).

After that, you can:

- Initialize git, push to GitHub
- Configure Docker Hub + CI/CD
- Deploy on your VM
